<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This app lets you convert numbers from the set ‚Ñö of rational numbers between different bases (including balanced ones, on which more below),
and between different representations such as positional notation and improper, mixed and continued fractions. The numbers can have basically arbitrary size and
precision.</p>
<p>To copy a result to the input line, short-tap it, and to copy it to the clipboard, long-tap it.</p>

<h2>Basics: positional notation</h2>
<p>Choose an input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix">base</a> from 2 to 36 via the slider or the shortcut buttons in the lower part of the screen,
and an output base via the corresponding controls in the upper part. If you choose to convert from DECimal (base 10) to HEXadecimal (base 16), an input of (say)
<code>345</code> is interpreted as <strong>3</strong>√ó10<sup>2</sup>+<strong>4</strong>√ó10<sup>1</sup>+<strong>5</strong>√ó10<sup>0</sup> and converted to
<strong>1</strong>√ó16<sup>2</sup>+<strong>5</strong>√ó16<sup>1</sup>+<strong>9</strong>√ó16<sup>0</sup>, which is displayed as 159.</p>
<p>Digits from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> work as expected. Those with values higher than 9 are represented by letters, from <code>A</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10
to <code>Z</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;35; and they are case insensitive so you don‚Äôt have to use Shift for your input. Spaces are ignored.</p>
<p>Tap ‚Äúin: base‚Äù or ‚Äúout: base‚Äù to display the digit range for the currently selected base.</p>

<h2>Balanced numeral systems</h2>
<p>Qonvert also supports balanced numeral systems (the best-known being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary">balanced ternary</a>, i.e.
base 3) for odd bases via the switches next to the base buttons: when switched on, the letters <code>J</code> to <code>Z</code> have <em>negative</em> values, with
<code>Z</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;‚àí1, <code>Y</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;‚àí2, down to <code>J</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;‚àí17. Thus, in balanced ternary, <code>10Z</code> means
<strong>1</strong>√ó3<sup>2</sup>+<strong>0</strong>√ó3<sup>1</sup><strong>‚àí1</strong>√ó3<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;8.</p>

<h2>Non-integers in positional notation</h2>
<p>Digits after a radix point <code>.</code> are of course interpreted as the fractional part of the number: <code>1.A6</code> in DOZenal (base 12) is
<strong>1</strong>√ó12<sup>0</sup>+<strong>10</strong>√ó12<sup>‚àí1</sup>+<strong>6</strong>√ó12<sup>‚àí2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.875. If there is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal">repeating part</a>, mark its start with a single quote <code>\'</code>:
For example, <code>0.1\'486</code> means 0.1486486486‚Ä¶, and <code>21\'3.4</code> means 213.43434‚Ä¶.</p>
<p>The result of your conversion has always either a finite number of digits after the radix point or a repeating part. Sometimes, though, the representation
can be very long. To keep the app from freezing, the search for an exact representation stops after 300 digits by default. You can change this value in
the settings.</p>
<p>If your screen is too small to show all the output formats (positional, fraction, mixed number, continued fraction), you can swipe the output area up and down.</p>

<h2>Fractions</h2>
<p>Type a numerator and a denominator separated with a slash <code>/</code>, as in <code>6/8</code> or <code>1.5/2</code>. Fractions are reduced or expanded
as necessary, so both of these inputs will result in 3/4.</p>
<p>For mixed numbers, separate integer and fractional part with an underscore <code>_</code>: for example, <code>1_9/8</code> or
<code>1.\'3&nbsp;_&nbsp;1/3</code>. Fractions with an absolute value over 1 will be shown both as improper fractions (17/8 or 5/3 in our examples)
and as mixed numbers (2_1/8 or 1_2/3).</p>

<h2>Continued fractions</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">Continued fractions</a> start with an integer part, followed by a semicolon <code>;</code> and
a comma-separated list of denominators. Square brackets are used for output but are optional for input.</p>
<p><code>2;3,4</code>, for example, means 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/(3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/4), which evaluates to 2.\'307692, 30/13, and 2_4/13.</p>
<p>Input of non-integer numbers, including fractions, is okay: <code>1.5;&nbsp;2/3,&nbsp;1_1/5</code> is simplified to [2;&nbsp;6].
All continued fractions are displayed with positive denominators, so <code>-3;-1,-1,-18</code> becomes [‚àí4;&nbsp;2,&nbsp;18].</p>

<h2>Negative numbers</h2>
<p>Apropos negative numbers: you can type them either in ordinary notation with a leading minus <code>-</code>, or in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_complements">complement notation</a> with two leading points <code>..</code>: these points basically mean
‚Äúthe highest digit in this base repeated all the way to the left‚Äù. Complement notation is known from computing, where ‚àí1 is represented as hexadecimal FFFFFFFF,
‚àí2 as FFFFFFFE, and so on (with as many F‚Äôs as there is space). So, typing <code>..D</code> in hexadecimal or <code>..7</code> in decimal both mean ‚àí3.</p>
<p>Output of negative numbers is either in ordinary or complement notation, depending on the switch at the top right.</p>

<h2>Input with base tokens</h2>
<p>You can type in numbers in binary, octal, decimal, dozenal and hexadecimal without changing the input base, and even use different bases for integer part,
numerator and denominator of a fraction, or for the numbers in a continued fraction. To do this, prefix a number with one of these tokens:</p>
<ul>
 <li>binary: <code>@</code></li>
 <li>octal: <code>‚ãï</code></li>
 <li>decimal: <code>$</code>, <code>‚Ç¨</code>, <code>¬£</code>, or <code>¬•</code></li>
 <li>dozenal: <code>%</code></li>
 <li>hexadecimal: <code>&</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Try typing <code>@10010&nbsp;/&nbsp;&13</code> or <code>‚ãï12;&nbsp;@1010,&nbsp;$10</code>.</p>

<h2>Unicode characters</h2>
<p>Inputs that are integers between hexadecimal <code>20</code> and <code>32000</code> (decimal <code>32</code> and <code>204800</code>) are not only converted
to their representation in the output base, but also to the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> character.</p>
<p>Conversely, type double quotes <code>\"</code> followed by any character to find its Unicode encoding. This only works for single characters,
not composed ones such as certain letter-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritic</a> combinations, people with skin tones, or flags.</p>
<p>The Web has excellent sources to find Unicode characters by name; but if you want to know the Unicode representation of the tortoise in balanced undecimal,
Qonvert is your <strong>only</strong> source. (The answer is 1YX215.)</p>
<p>And if anybody asks ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, the answer is ‚Äúbecause‚Äù.</p>
