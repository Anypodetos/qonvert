# Lemizh constellations
This is the code for the [celestial sphere](https://lemizh.conlang.org/appendix/constell/webgl.php) and [constellation list](https://lemizh.conlang.org/appendix/constell.php) in my conworld Lemizh.

Published in the hope that someone who wants to create a 3D interactive celestial sphere for web browsers might find it useful.
